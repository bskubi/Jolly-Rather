Jolly Rather is an implementation of the Final Version Perfected task prioritization algorithm, which I learned about here:

The basic idea is that you compare two options at a time until you've found the best thing to do next. Then you do it, and then start comparing options for the next task.
This is a lightweight app. You can update the todo list, which loads and saves automatically when you start or quit the program. You can also control the process with
a simple button interface.
