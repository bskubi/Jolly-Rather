The prioritizer class implements Final Version Perfected, a task prioritization algorithm
It works as follows:
* Make an unordered list of your todo tasks. Mark the first as "option 1" and the second as "option 2"
* At each step, choose whether you'd rather do option 1 or option 2.
* If you'd rather do option 1, make the next task down the list into option 2
* If you'd rather do option 2, mark it and make the next task down the list into option 2
* If you reach the end of the list:
* * First, do the most recent task you marked
* * Then, set the second-most-recent marked task as option 1 and start comparing options again
